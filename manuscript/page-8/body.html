    <h2> Virat's Captaincy </h2>
        <p>
        Virat Kohli has more of an aggressive kind of personality and he likes to play in the same mode. He is not afraid to take risks which is a quality of a good captain. He has been able to maintain India at the No. 1 spot in Test Cricket. India is number 2 on the T20 rankings both of which has Kohli as Captain for sometime now.

        <p>
         Virat Kohli is an innovative Cricketer who is at his best when the situation is challenging due to being MANGLIK in nature and also Rahu is posited in 3rd House of courage, efforts. Also not to forget a benefic Jupiter in 6th House of competition gives him this drive to try and excel in difficult circumstances. All these characterstics of Virat Kohli bode well for Indian Cricket in all the 3 formats but he needs to reign in his aggressiveness and channelise it on the cricket field.
