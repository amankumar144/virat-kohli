        Anushka's 5th Lord is also Mars and is placed in 4th House of Virat. This cancels the Manglik dosha for both of them. This placement of Mars shall give Virat a high rank, royal status and he'll continue to perform better. 7th Lord, Mercury, of Virat's Chart is placed in 10th with Sun and Jupiter in Anushka's chart. Anushka's 7th Lord, Saturn, is placed in Ascendant of Virat. This is a mixed situation and will give them their periods of trial.

         Similarily, the placement of 8th Lord, Moon, of Virat's chart in 4th House of Anushka and 8th Lord, Saturn, of Anushka's chart in Virat's Ascendant is a mixed placement for them. Overall their relationship is a good one though just like any other relationships they would have their periods of trial particularly in the periods where Saturn and Moon are involved.
