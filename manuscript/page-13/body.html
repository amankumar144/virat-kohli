        Anushka's 5th Lord is also Mars and is placed in 4th House of Virat. This cancels the Manglik dosha for both of them. This makes their marriage preferable. They will be adventurous, outgoing and social. Virat will support Anushka by all means and will be loyal to her. She will also give full support to him in form of knowledge, skills, ideas and intelligence. They will have lots of things in common and enjoy the company of each other. They will be supportive, loving, and caring.

         However, they have Bhakoot Dosha, which determines love compatibility. There will be disagreements between them related to family and financial matters. Overall their relationship is a good one though, just like any other relationships they would have some sort of ebbs and flows.
