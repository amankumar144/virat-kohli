        <h2> Relationship with Anushka </h2>
        <p>
           Anushka Sharma was born with Cancer Ascendant, with the Ascendant Lord, Moon placed in 4th House of home, mother, material comforts, domestic and mental peace. Ascendant Lord of Virat, Jupiter, is placed in 10th House in friendly Sign of Aries, in Anushka's chart.      
         </p>
        <p>
            2nd Lord, Sun, of Anushka's chart is involved in Neech Bhanga Raja Yoga in 11th House, in Virat's chart. This is a good position of Anushka and shall give her greater gains in career, wealth etc. 5th Lord, Mars, of Virat's chart is exalted in Anushka's chart in 7th House. This indicates some problems at the emotional front for Virat.
