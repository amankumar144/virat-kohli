        <p>
        Cricket World Cup would be held in England from 30<sup>th</sup> May 2019 to 15<sup>th</sup> July 2017. During this period, Virat will be undergoing the period of Rahu mahadasha and Mercury antardasha. Mercury is the 10th Lord placed in 11th House of gains, rise, aspecting 5th House of positivity, conjunct with the 9th Lord of fortune, luck.

        Moon, is 8th Lord of suddeness, placed in 10th House conjunct with 11th Lord of gains, and 6th Lord of competition, Venus. Mars is 5th Lord of positivity, placed in 4th House and adding strength to the 10th House by aspect.

        It is also the Lord of displacement, losses, foreign travels. Transit-wise this period does not look to be conducive for Virat Kohli, thus the next World Cup could be a mixed bag for India and Virat Kohli. </p>
